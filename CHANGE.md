# Project Change Log

This file is the shared record of changes made to the project by humans or agents.

## Mandatory agent workflow

Every agent must:

1. Read this file before inspecting or changing project files.
2. Check the existing entries for related work, constraints, and unfinished changes.
3. Record every project change in this file before completing the task.
4. Include the date, a short summary, the files changed, and verification performed.
5. Never delete or rewrite historical entries. Add a new entry instead.

Documentation-only changes, configuration changes, dependency changes, source changes, asset changes, and test changes all count as project changes and must be recorded.

## Entry format

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD — Short change title

- Summary: What changed and why.
- Files: `path/to/file`, `path/to/another-file`
- Verification: Commands run and their result, or `Not run` with the reason.
```

## 2026-08-26 — Add shared change-tracking workflow

- Summary: Added this project-wide change log and documented the mandatory read-before-change and write-after-change workflow for all agents.
- Files: `CHANGE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- Verification: Reviewed the new instructions and confirmed the files are present in the repository.

## 2026-08-26 — Centralize WOS and contact destinations

- Summary: Added shared constants for WOS admin, ePOS, and customer website links plus contact/social URLs; connected the WOS constellation nodes and active-build surfaces to those destinations.
- Files: `src/core/constants.js`, `src/data/projects.js`, `src/modules/home/presentation/command-center/SystemCore.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/command-center/ActiveBuild.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/command-center/command-center.css`, `src/components/Footer.astro`, `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/Hero.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/HomePage.jsx`, `src/pages/index.astro`, `tests/core-constants.test.mjs`
- Verification: `npm run build` passed. A direct constants assertion passed; Node's test runner could not start in this Windows sandbox because it returned `spawn EPERM`. A source scan confirmed the external destinations only remain in `src/core/constants.js`.

## 2026-08-26 — Align Sprint 1 with portfolio trend guidance

- Summary: Reviewed Envato’s 2026 portfolio-trends guidance and added project guardrails for purposeful micro-interactions, persistent contact access, dark-mode/color-brand continuity, real project imagery, and restrained retro-futurist texture. Explicitly rejected puzzle navigation, noisy decoration, and trend-driven palette drift.
- Files: `PRODUCT.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-system-command-center-design.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-26-system-command-center.md`, `CHANGE.md`
- Verification: Compared the article guidance with the current Sprint 1 product brief, command-center design, and implementation plan; no source behavior changes were required for this alignment pass.

## 2026-08-26 — Build holographic product constellation

- Summary: Replaced the hero’s single featured command-center visual with a responsive, data-driven product constellation showing every supplied project. WOS remains the selected build and the existing command center remains below it; selection stays synchronized through the existing controller.
- Files: `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/constellationData.js`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/ProductConstellation.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/HeroVisual.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/hero.css`, `tests/product-constellation.test.mjs`, `CHANGE.md`
- Verification: Direct artifact-data assertions passed, `npm run build` passed, desktop Playwright interaction confirmed artifact selection updates the active build, and mobile browser evaluation confirmed the constellation fits the hero column without document overflow. The standalone Python smoke script could not run because `playwright` is not installed in the Python environment.

## 2026-08-27 — Implement Page 1 Command Portal with 3D Globe, Mascot Crew & System Overview

- Summary: Re-architected Page 1 into a clean, focused 3-column entry portal. Added the exact typographic hook on the left with the Image 1 tactical CTA (`SYSTEM ACCESS • ONLINE`, `[ ENTER COMMAND CENTER >> ]`, `EXPLORE WORK >>`), a central 3D Holographic Particle Globe with playing Aero & Dash mascots (grounded in the official Image 2 character sheet), and the right-side `SYSTEM OVERVIEW •` telemetry panel. Placed the full Command Center below the hero with smooth scroll navigation.
- Files: `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/HeroContent.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/HolographicGlobe.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/MascotCrew.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/SystemOverviewCard.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/HeroVisual.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/Hero.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/hero/hero.css`, `src/modules/home/presentation/HomePage.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/home.css`, `tests/hero-content.test.mjs`, `tests/holographic-globe.test.mjs`, `tests/mascot-crew.test.mjs`, `tests/system-overview.test.mjs`, `CHANGE.md`
- Verification: All 4 Node unit tests passed (`hero-content.test.mjs`, `holographic-globe.test.mjs`, `mascot-crew.test.mjs`, `system-overview.test.mjs`). `npm run build` compiled cleanly in 1.74s with zero errors.

## 2026-08-27 — Overhaul and elevate top bar on Portfolio Page 1

- Summary: Rebuilt the top navigation bar into a full-width, sticky frosted glass HUD header (`SiteHeader`). Added active scroll-spy section tracking (`01 // OVERVIEW`, `02 // COMMAND CENTER`, `03 // ACTIVE BUILDS`, `04 // CONTACT`), real-time formatted local telemetry clock with seconds, pulsing green system online beacon, GitHub and LinkedIn quick portals, theme switcher integration, high-conversion tactical contact CTA (`LET'S TALK [ ↗ ]`), and a fully accessible responsive mobile menu drawer with keyboard navigation support.
- Files: `src/modules/home/presentation/header/SiteHeader.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/header/header.css`, `src/modules/home/presentation/HomePage.jsx`, `src/modules/home/presentation/home.css`, `tests/site-header.test.mjs`, `CHANGE.md`
- Verification: Ran `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` with all 11 unit tests passing. Ran `npm run build` with 106 modules transforming and building cleanly in 1.60s without errors.
